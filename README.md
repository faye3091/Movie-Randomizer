# Movie Randomizer

## Description

Our motivation for this project was to make a fun way to pick a movie when you are not really sure what you should watch for the night. So in this project we put together a website that will randomize a movie pulling the info from the extensive IMDB library of top 250 movies to make sure there are many options to be picked from. Afterwards you are able to use the link at the bottom to take you to a list of places to stream the movie you found this way you don't need to go searching around for it. While working on this project we learned a lot about how to use external APIs and using github collabartion in order to make pull requests and have our peers review them before merging out content in to the main branch. The problem that is solved with our project is helping people pick out a movie to watch when nothing else comes to mind or something that people who have seen a lot of movies can use to maybe discover something new to watch.
